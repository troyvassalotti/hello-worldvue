        Hello WorldVue is a <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue-based</a> app for
        visualizing KMZ, KML, and GPX files in a
        <a href="https://leafletjs.com">Leaflet</a> map. To view your map,
        upload a relevant track below.

      <h2>This is Private!</h2>
      <p>
        This app doesn't use a database and I have no way of knowing details
        about the files you upload. I've restricted you to only uploading
        specific file types and that's that. All files are accessed in the
        browser and loaded as Object URLs in the map. When you close this
        window, those Object URLs are revoked (as is the nature of Object URLs)
        and you can safely reload this app at square one.
